	<p>You think you can outsmart this game??? Well think again buddy because this isn't a game for children. It's gonna have to be BIG BRAIN TIME for you. That's right, you're gonna have to align ALL your chakras to win this one. Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

	<p>So you liked my game, huh? If you beat it, follow me on <a class="socials" href="https://github.com/reginapizza" target="_blank">github </a> or my <a class="socials" href="https://www.instagram.com/reginapizza/?hl=en" target="_blank">instagram</a> and slide into my DM's so I can look at the face of the god who has overcome my trial. If you were no match for my memory game (it's okay, please remember that common folk really stand no chance against it) follow me on social media anyway because I like the attention.</p><p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk. </p>
